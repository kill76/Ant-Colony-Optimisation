## Killian Jaubert / Rafael Cartenet

Project developed during our studies at INSA.

Our algorithm and the different formulas we used are based on the research paper available in this repository :

M. Dorigo, V. Maniezzo, and A. Colorni, “Ant system: optimization by a colony of cooperating agents” in SMC.
IEEE, 1996, pp. 29–41.
